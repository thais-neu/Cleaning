### Safety

Wear a lab coat, gloves and closed-toe shoes whenever cleaning plastic- and glassware.

Typically, we use 10% bleach and 2-5% HCl solutions. 

  Note: HCl concentration depends on normality of the stock HCl solution.
  
  Note: *never never* open the stock HCl bottle outside of the hood!
  
Bleach and HCl solutions should be kept in the hood, especially when an open-bucket bleach or HCl bath are needed. 

Baths should be equal to or less than half of the full volume of the buckets.

*Never* have a bleach and a HCl bath in the hood at the same time. 

Label everything that is in the hood ("10% bleach" or "2% HCl"), especially if leaving overnight, plus date and your initials.

Do not leave an open-bucket bath in the hood longer than than necessary.


### Procedure

-- Rinse plastic- and glassware well with warm tap water to remove any visible residue, like built-up salt. 

-- If needed, use soap and scrub with a toothbrush or sponge. Rinse *really* well with warm tap water to eliminate soap residue. 

-- Rinse 2x with DI water to eliminate tap water residue and avoid tap water carry over into the baths. 


### Glassware - acid washed and combusted.

-- Soak in 2-5% HCl solution overnight. Keep in the hood. 

-- Rinse 5x with DI water to eliminate any HCl residue. At this point, it is more efficient to bring the glassware to the wet lab to rinse with DI directly from the tap. If you're doing that, remember to take your gloves off to open lab doors.

-- Let it air dry upside-down on paper towel. 

-- When completely dry, cover with aluminium foil and combust at 450oC. Ask Thais to do this step.

Note: volumetric glassware (flasks and cylinders) are *never* combusted.

-- Store supercleaned glassware in the glassware cupboard, on the shelf labeled accordingly.



### Plasticware - bleached and acid-washed.

-- Soak in 10% bleach for 2-3 hours (overnight if cleaning black plate reader plates).

-- Rinse *really* well with warm tap water to remove all bleach. Keep in the hood.

-- Rinse 2x with DI water to eliminate tap water residue and avoid tap water carry over into the HCl bath.

-- Soak in 2-5% HCl solution overnight. Keep in the hood. 

-- Rinse 5x with DI water to eliminate any HCl residue. At this point, it is more efficient to bring the plasticware to the wet lab to rinse with DI directly from the tap. If you're doing that, remember to take your gloves off to open lab doors.

Note: black plates used with the plate reader need to be soaked in DI water for a couple of hours after the last DI rinse step to make sure all HCl is rinsed off. Then rinse once more with DI water. They come in direct contact with samples so they also need to be tested before using. See Thais for testing.

-- Let it air dry upside-down on paper towel until *completely* dry.

-- Store in a sealed, labeled bag on the corresponding shelf.
